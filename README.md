# Checkmarx PS CI/CD Tools

These are tools used for CI/CD integrations authored by Checkmarx Professional Services.  These
were made to perform some common functions in a way that is portable
across build environments.  The tools are implemented in Java and intended to run with a JRE version >= 17.

These are not intended for public use.

However, if you really want to explore these tools, each published tool is an executable with command line option documentation.
